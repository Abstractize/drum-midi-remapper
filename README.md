## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abstractize/drum-midi-remapper.git
cd drum-midi-remapper
dotnet build
dotnet run --project src/CLI -- GuitarPro StevenSlate midis/test.mid
```

- Replace `GuitarPro`, `StevenSlate`, and `midis/test.mid` with your desired mappings and MIDI file.

---

## Requirements

- [.NET 9.0 SDK or newer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

---

## Features

- Remap MIDI drum notes using customizable JSON mapping files  
- Support for popular drum mapping standards (e.g., GuitarPro, StevenSlate, LogicPro, ProTools)  
- Batch processing of MIDI files via CLI  
- Cross-platform support powered by .NET 9  
- Modular architecture with Dependency Injection for easy extensibility

---

## Usage

Run the tool with:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/CLI -- <SourceMap> <TargetMap> <InputMidiFile>
```

- `<SourceMap>` and `<TargetMap>`: Mapping names (see **Available Mappings** below)  
- `<InputMidiFile>`: Path to the MIDI file to remap

The `--project src/CLI` option specifies the CLI project.

---

## Available Mappings

Mappings are stored as JSON files in the **Services/Resources/Maps/** directory. Specify the mapping name as a command-line argument when running the tool.

Included mappings:

- GuitarPro  
- LogicPro  
- ProTools  
- StevenSlate

You can also create custom mappings by adding JSON files to the directory.

---

## Configuration

Mapping files are JSON documents located in **Services/Resources/Maps/**. Edit or add files to customize drum note mappings.

### Example Mapping File (`ExampleMap.json`)

```json
{
    "name": "ExampleMap",
    "mapping": {
        "Kick": 36,
        "Snare": 38,
        "HiHatClosed": 42,
        "HiHatOpen": 46,
        "TomLow": 41,
        "TomMid": 45,
        "TomHigh": 48,
        "Crash": 49,
        "Ride": 51
    }
}
```

- `"name"`: Identifier for the map  
- Values correspond to MIDI note numbers

> **Note:** MIDI note numbers follow the [General MIDI Percussion Key Map](https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/gm-level-1-sound-set). This project uses [DryWetMIDI](https://melanchall.github.io/drywetmidi/) for MIDI handling.

---

## Example

**Input:** MIDI file mapped for GuitarPro  
**Command:**

```bash
dotnet run --project src/CLI -- GuitarPro StevenSlate midis/test.mid
```

**Output:** MIDI file remapped for StevenSlate drums, saved in the current working directory.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

- **Build errors:** Ensure .NET 9 SDK is installed and your environment is configured correctly.  
- **Mapping not found:** Verify spelling and that JSON mapping files exist in **Services/Resources/Maps/**.  
- **MIDI file issues:** Confirm your input file is a valid MIDI file and accessible.

### Adding a New Mapping

1. Add a JSON mapping file to **Services/Resources/Maps/**  
2. Follow the existing file format for your mapping  
3. Update the `DrumMapType` enum in `Models/DrumMapType.cs` to include your new map
